    "Our main purpose of this model is predicting US families' annual recreation spending.And the above equation has done the job for us.Lets interpret what that chunk of equation means in real term.Our constant or bias term for our model is 873.It is the value that our expenditure prediction value assumes when when there is zero annual income.the second part in the equation can be interpreted as given that the effects of all other variables is zero for every $100 increase in annual income there is an increase of expenditure by 12 cents i.e 100 X 0.0012 and additionally as in the third part of the equation, There is an increase of expenditure by 20 cents i.e 100 times 100 times 0.00002 which totals up to 32 cents of average increase in expenditure for every 100 average increase in annual income.The fourth part of the equation can be interpreted as families with kids spend on average 223.57 less than families without kids on recreation.This is possibly because they have another priorities to spend on.<br/>\n",
