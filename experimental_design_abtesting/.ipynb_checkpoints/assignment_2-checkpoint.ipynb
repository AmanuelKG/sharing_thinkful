    "When it comes to sampling,Before drawing our random samples from the February and May email advertisements we have to be cautious of lurcking variables or dependancies between the email addresses.We do not want to send the same email address the advertisement on February and May as the former may influence the later.We have to be cautious as well not to send the advertisment to majority females as females might be more interested on our product(bathing suit than) than men or vice versa.The same may apply with the age group.As those variables are obvious once that might influence our result,we have to make sure to address those biases properly.If we fill it is neccessary we can implement A/A testing to find out if other lurcking variables are hiden behaind our intended analysis.Therefore my assumption is that the two samples are similiar and are randomly selected from the same population.And they are solely different because they are selected from different months."

The two versions of effects are the visits before and after the launch of the loyalty program.determining the effect of the launch in number of visits is the key catch in this senaio.To be able to determine that we have to assume that there was steady number of visits on the weeks before the launch of the loyalty program.And also we have to assume that there was no other measure event that influenced the visits such as events,holydays.But most importantly we have to draw the samples from the two populations randomly."
