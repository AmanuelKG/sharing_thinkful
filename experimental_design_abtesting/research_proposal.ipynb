    "In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu.The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet, And disputed the finding as unrealistic and called for a proper scientific analysis which the Jedi approved."

    "In conducting the Experimentation we will divide the planets in to friendly and unfriendly.Our primary assumption is that the planets are equally friendly and unfriendly.Out of the friendly planets we will randomly select 4 planets and we will randomly select 4 planets from the unfriendly in the same way.these 8 planets will be the once that we will be conducting our experimentation.we random sample 2 independent samples from each planets and make them ready for their encounter with the two envoys and the data is collected based on the feedback from the people in the planets.Then the data is analysed to test their success comparison."
